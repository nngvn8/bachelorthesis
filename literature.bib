  abstract = {The massive growth in the scale of data has been observed in recent years being a key factor of the Big Data scenario. Big Data can be defined as high volume, velocity and variety of data that require a new high-performance processing. Addressing big data is a challenging and time-demanding task that requires a large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing and analysis. The presence of data preprocessing methods for data mining in big data is reviewed in this paper. The definition, characteristics, and categorization of data preprocessing approaches in big data are introduced. The connection between big data and data preprocessing throughout all families of methods and big data technologies are also examined, including a review of the state-of-the-art. In addition, research challenges are discussed, with focus on developments on different big data framework, such as Hadoop, Spark and Flink and the encouragement in devoting substantial research efforts in some families of data preprocessing methods and applications on new big data learning paradigms.},

  title    = {Interactive Visualization Meets Probabilistic Model Checking},
  abstract = {State-of-the-art Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) offers
multiple engines for the quantitative analysis of Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), including rewards modeling cost or utility values. Despite the
huge amount of internally computed information, support for debugging
and facilities that enhance the understandability of PMC models and
results are very limited. As a first step to improve on that, we present
the basic principles of PMC-Vis, a tool that supports the exploration
of large MDPs together with the computed PMC-results per MDP-state
through interactive visualization. By combining visualization techniques,
such as node-link diagrams and parallel coordinates, with quantitative
analysis capabilities, PMC-Vis supports users in gaining insights into the
probabilistic behavior of MDPs and PMC-results and enables different
ways to explore the behaviour of schedulers of multiple target properties.
The usefulness of PMC-Vis is demonstrated through three different
application scenarios.},

  abstract   = {Mathematical software and graph-theoretical algorithmic packages to efficiently model, analyze, and query graphs are crucial in an era where large-scale spatial, societal, and economic network data are abundantly available. One such package is JGraphT, a programming library that contains very efficient and generic graph data structures along with a large collection of state-of-the-art algorithms. The library is written in Java with stability, interoperability, and performance in mind. A distinctive feature of this library is its ability to model vertices and edges as arbitrary objects, thereby permitting natural representations of many common networks, including transportation, social, and biological networks. Besides classic graph algorithms such as shortest-paths and spanning-tree algorithms, the library contains numerous advanced algorithms: graph and subgraph isomorphism, matching and flow problems, approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems such as independent set and the traveling salesman problem, and several more exotic algorithms such as Berge graph detection. Due to its versatility and generic design, JGraphT is currently used in large-scale commercial products, as well as noncommercial and academic research projects. In this work, we describe in detail the design and underlying structure of the library, and discuss its most important features and algorithms. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance of JGraphT versus several similar libraries. Experiments on a large number of graphs over a variety of popular algorithms show that JGraphT is highly competitive with other established libraries such as NetworkX or the BGL.},
