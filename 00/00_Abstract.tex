%	modern age, relies on information and communication technology
%	one crucial aspect is: fault-free behavior. 
%	Model checking is one technique to verify systems
%	major limitation is the state explosion problem
%	not only problem for model checking but also for humans interacting
%	This thesis we present the concept view in the context of the project \pmcvis, preprocessing data for visualization aimed at aiding human understanding. 
%	We formalize the concept, define operations on it, consider different types and propose several example views utilizing characteristics of an mdp at well as its graph structure. In addition we provide an implementation within the project \pmcvis

In today's world, our dependence on information and communications technology (ICT) is profound. Ensuring fault-free behavior is crucial. Model checking verifies systems, but faces challenges due to the state explosion problem, which affects both algorithms and human comprehension. This thesis introduces the concept of \emph{\viewN}, which preprocesses data for visualization to enhance human understanding. We formalize and define views for Markov Decision Processes (\mdpsN), present operations and types, and propose example views using \mdpN features as well as the graph structure of \mdpsN. An Java implementation of the concept and examples is provided within the project \pmcvis.
